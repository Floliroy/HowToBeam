# HowToBeam

This is the first version of my first Add-On.

This Add-On will look at you stats and then calculate if you need to use Radiant Oppression or another skill to get the best DPS as possible. The calculations depends (mostly) on health percentage of the target and on you current magicka percentage.
I will try to keep it update, and to improve it to personalise the Add-On as much as possible and to get more accurate results.

Special thanks to Solinur / decay who helped me a lot with the calculations and with the code.
